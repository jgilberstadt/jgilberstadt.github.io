# Josh Gilberstadt Personal Portfolio PWA
#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
This repository hosts a progressive web app (PWA) showcasing my coding projects. It contains three pages: an about page, a projects page, and a contact page. The about page describes my work experience, education, and future software development goals. It also contains two buttons that allow the user to download my resume and be redirected to the projects page. I decided to make the about page the home page of the website so the user knows about the type of work I do before they review my projects or decide to contact me. The projects page displays four coding projects that I've selected and provides a description of the project and the languages/libraries that were used to create the project. The projects are also hyperlinked to the repositories storing the code for each project. There is also a button at the bottom of the projects page that redirects the user to the contact page if they decide they want to contact me after reviewing my projects. The contact page contains several buttons that, when clicked, allow the user to either send an email or visit my LinkedIn or GitHub account.

I created header and footer partial files to minimize redundant code and improve overall readability. My name is in the left side of the header, and it sends the user to the about page when it's clicked. The right side of the header on the desktop mode lists all three pages while the mobile version contains a menu button that displays all three pages when clicked, allowing the user to switch pages by clicking on the page they want to see. The desktop layout is more horizontal while the mobile layout is more vertical, so I created these two different layouts to display the menu in the way that best fits the device the user is using. There is also a sun/moon button in the right edge of the header that allows the user to toggle the light/dark mode. The footer lists my name and location and also contains links to my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

I also created several supplementary files that contain various formatting and structural properties. The menu.js file contains the JavaScript functions used in the PWA. There are 

Pages:
- `index.html` — About (site root)
- `contact.html` — Contact
- `projects.html` — Projects

The site is served as static HTML/CSS with a small JavaScript menu.
