# Josh Gilberstadt Personal Portfolio PWA
#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
This repository hosts a progressive web app (PWA) showcasing my coding projects.
It contains three pages: an about page, a projects page, and a contact page. The about page
describes my work experience, education, and future software development goals. The projects page
displays four coding projects that I've selected and provides a description of the project and
the languages/libraries that were used to create the project. The projects are also hyperlinked to the
repositories storing the code for each project. The contact page contains several buttons that,
when clicked, allow the user to either send an email or visit my LinkedIn or Github account.

I created header and footer partial files to minimize redundant code and improve overall readability.
My name is in the left side of the header, and it sends the user to the about page when it's clicked.
The right side of the header lists 

I also created several supplementary files that contain various formatting and structural properties.


Pages:
- `index.html` — About (site root)
- `contact.html` — Contact
- `projects.html` — Projects

The site is served as static HTML/CSS with a small JavaScript menu.
