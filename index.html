    <h1>Bridging Mathematics & Data Engineering</h1>
  
    <p>
      I am a <strong>Data Manager and Engineer</strong> based in St. Louis, Missouri. 
      With a background in Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, I specialize in 
      transforming complex biological datasets into scalable, automated, and interpretable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the past four years, I have worked at the intersection of clinical research and computational 
      science. My work focuses on optimizing <strong>Alzheimer’s disease biomarker pipelines</strong>—specifically 
      by engineering data workflows and automating QC processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I’ve been expanding my toolkit into cloud architecture as an <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong>, 
      aiming to build the next generation of secure, cloud-native research environments.
